<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.
--> 


# Include some data examples in your package

<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below
-->


# check_primary_color_is_ok

    

  

```{r example-check_primary_color_is_ok, eval = FALSE}
check_primary_color_is_ok("Cinnamon")

```

  

  



# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
